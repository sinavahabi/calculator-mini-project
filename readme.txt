Web Application Calculator

Features: Basic, HTML events, Error handling, Nested “setTimeout”, DOM Searching, Responsive page

Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

''' This is my very first programming with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, so these codes are very basic and primary.'''
Here we have a basic web application calculator which has some Math functions such as round, ceil, floor, square root, absolute and exponentiation mathematical operators beside basic calculations which is done by “eval” function.
In this program, some “undefined” and “NaN” outputs are handled by JavaScript conditional operators like “try catch(e)” or simple if-else statement.
There is also a digital clock feature which has been added by using nested setTimeout which gives the user exact momentary date and time.
This mini project includes more error handling and proper responds to user when they commit wrong actions. For example, when they try to perform mathematical operation on a negative number, the program will disable all buttons except reset button ("C") and, replaces recent values on calculator display with (“Invalid Input”) message.
So, user has to click on reset button ("C") in order to be able to continue using calculator. Also calculator appearance will look different when buttons are disabled. Buttons opacity will decrease and cursor will be set as "not-allowed" when user hovers the mouse on buttons.
Note that After user clicks on reset ("C") button to continue calculating, everything will go back to normal and appearance will change accordingly.
After some updates this project also included responsive page capability for devices with less than 992px and, 576px width.
Note: This mini project was completely handled by git.
Note: Codes documentation and descriptions are more obvious in comments among the codes on each file.
