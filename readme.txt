Web Application Calculator

Features: Basic, HTML "onclick" event, Error handling, Nested “setTimeout”

Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

''' This is my very first programming with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, so these codes are very basic and primary.'''
Here we have a basic web application calculator which has some Math methods such as round, ceil, floor, square root, absolute and exponentiation mathematical operators beside basic calculations which is done by “eval” function.
In this program, some “undefined” and “NaN” errors are somehow handled by JavaScript alerts or setting the calculators display empty (0); that is all done by using basic conditional statements.
There is also a digital clock feature which has been added by using nested setTimeout which gives the user exact momentary date and time.
Note: This mini project was completely handled by git.
